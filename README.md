## Description
What is [Medusa](https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/) ?

### Automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows. It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its magic.

#### Exclusive features
 - Supports TVMaze and TMDB indexers
 - Manual search episodes (you choose what to snatch based on all kind of info: provider, seeds, release group)
 - Manual search for subtitles (useful when subtitle has low score because of typo in filename or alternative title)
 - Uses 'guessit' library to parse and enrich existing info (more precise than regexes)
 - Improved Anime shows support
 - Faster DailySearcher|Backlog|Find propers as we only process new items. Already processed items are discarded.
 - Option to clean Kodi library when replacing existing files
 - Better quality explanations and consistent quality code in all threads
 - See on the fly if your backlogged episodes will be increased/reduced while changing qualities
 - Postpone Post Processing until Medusa downloads wanted subtitle (useful to only show media if subtitle available)
 - Clean up any leftover files/folders if media file is deleted
 - Nightly showupdater updates only the season of the show, which has been updated by the indexer, for tvdb and tmdb.

 - Episode status management allows for mass failing seasons/episodes to force retrying
 - DVD Order numbering for returning the results in DVD order instead of Air-By-Date order
 - Allows you to choose which indexer to have Medusa search its show info from when importing
 - Automatic XEM Scene Numbering/Naming for seasons/episodes
